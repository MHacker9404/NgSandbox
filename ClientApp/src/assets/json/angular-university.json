For example, we are going to learn how to retry a network call in case of error. This is very useful in situations when the backend occasionally returns errors that are of an intermittent nature. In those scenarios a good strategy is to try to send the network call again a second time, usually after a certain delay has elapsed. In this lesson we are going to learn how we can use the RxJs Operators retry and retryWhen to implement service layers that are resilient to temporary errors."
